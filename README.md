# Case–Study Final Project Write–Up: Wildlife Image Collection & Gallery

## 1. Executive Summary
Flask web app for collecting and displaying wildlife photos. Users upload images, which are logged with metadata and shown in a public gallery.

Problem: Field ecologists and scientists need a simple way to collect wildlife images and track sightings over time, without complex tools or manual logging.

Solution: web app built with Flask that lets users upload wildlife photos from their phones or computers. The images are stored either in the cloud (using Azure Blob Storage) or on the local computer for demos, and they show up automatically in a public gallery. This makes it easy to check uploads, share data with field teams, and keep track of wildlife sightings over time, without needing complicated tools or manual logs.

## 2. System Overview
- **Course Concepts**: Name the specific module concept/tool you used.   Flask routing, file uploads, structured logging
- **Architecture Diagram**: Include a PNG in /assets and embed it here.     Flask app + uploads folder + JSON logs
- **Data/Models/Services**: List sources, sizes, formats, and licenses.       Images uploaded by users; logged in JSON

## 4. Design Decisions
Why this concept? Alternatives considered and why not chosen.
Tradeoffs: Performance, cost, complexity, maintainability.
Security/Privacy: Secrets mgmt, input validation, PII handling.
Ops: Logs/metrics, scaling considerations, known limitations.

## 5. Results & Evaluation
Screenshots or sample outputs (place assets in /assets).
Brief performance notes or resource footprint (if relevant).
Validation/tests performed and outcomes.


## 6. What’s Next
